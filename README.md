This website contains the UFO files for the phenomenological models used in the above paper to study collider constraints on Heavy Dark Mesons.

# Parameters
Give a list of the parameters and description

## Common to all models

 - Æž: mass ratio of dark pions to dark rho. We use benchmark values of 0.25, 0.45, and 0.55.
 - $N_D$: the number of dark colors. The benchmark value is 4.
 - others...

## Differences
 - Which UFO file is which

# Instructions
This will show how to use the
`update dependent` command in MadGraph so that everything remains consistent.
